# Static Dataset FAQ

## What is the difference between the static datasets?
The primary difference between the datasets is the time period when the data is captured. Each time period contains the most up-to-date data _at the moment in time when the dataset was created_.

|Dataset|Time of Capture|
|---|---|
|Snapshot | Typically 1 month after the timely filing deadline|
|One Year | 12 months after the timely filing deadline |
|Three Year | 34 months after the timely filing deadline |

### Snapshot Dataset
The Snapshot dataset is taken at a fixed date after the timely filing deadline has passed, typically one month after March 1. In the event that the dataset is regenerated after publication of the Snapshot, the published date for this dataset will be updated to reflect the new date. 

### One Year Dataset
The One Year dataset is taken at least 12 months after the [timely filing deadline](/documentation/2022/annual-filing-dates/) has passed for a given filing year and incorporates any resubmissions or late submissions that have been completed in that timeframe.   
 
Please note that due to the timing of the One Year data product's creation:

- The 2019 One Year datasets contain more than 12 months worth of updates.
- There are no One Year datasets for 2017 or 2018.

### Three Year Dataset
The Three Year dataset is taken at least 34 months after the [timely filing deadline](/documentation/2022/annual-filing-dates/) has passed for a given filing year and incorporates any resubmissions or late submissions that have been completed in that timeframe. The Three Year dataset is the final dataset published for any given collection year.

## Which dataset is used by the Data Browser?
The HMDA Data Browser tools ([Dataset Filtering](/data-browser/data/), [Maps](/data-browser/maps/), [Graphs](/data-browser/graphs/quarterly/)) use the latest available [static dataset](/data-publication/) (Three Year, One Year, Snapshot) for the selected year.  This ensures that the information being accessed is up-to-date, based on the latest data submitted by financial institutions. When new datasets are published each year, the HMDA Data Browser is also updated.

If you are looking for a particular year's data, or additional documentation about the datasets, please visit the [HMDA Data Publication page](/data-publication/).

## What static datasets are available?

This depends on the year for which you are accessing data.  For Annual filing periods, there is a three year window during which institutions may continue to submit updates to their filing data, so there are three separate static datasets which capture the progression of this data over time. 

| Dataset | Available Years |
|---|---|
| [Three Year National Loan-Level Dataset](/data-publication/three-year-national-loan-level-dataset/)|  2017, 2018|
| [One Year National Loan-Level Dataset](/data-publication/one-year-national-loan-level-dataset/)| 2019, 2020|
| [Snapshot National Loan-Level Dataset](/data-publication/snapshot-national-loan-level-dataset/)| 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021|
