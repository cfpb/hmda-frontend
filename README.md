# HMDA Frontend Projects

![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/coverage-95%25-green)

The HMDA Frontend monorepo hosts the public facing applications for the collection, publication, and navigation of millions of HMDA records per year. This repository combines six, previously separate, React application repos in order to simplify component sharing, synchronize versioning of common dependencies, and improve rendering efficiency when navigating between apps.

## Technical Overview

Each React application lives in it's own sub-directory of the `/src` folder, with shared assets and components housed in `/common`. All sub-applications are rendered as asynchronous components within an application shell `/App.jsx` that provides a common header. This approach eliminates unneccesary reloading of the site-wide navigation, giving the separate apps a more connected feel. [React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/) is used for client side routing with [React Redux](https://redux.js.org/) integrated for state management of the more complex apps, such as Filing. [Unit tests](#unit-tests) are developed using Enzyme and [end-to-end](#end-to-end-testing) testing performed with Cypress. Dependencies are managed with [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started).

## Applications

## Development

### Requirements

- Node >= v20.8.0
- Yarn berry >= v4.0.2

### Installation

- Clone repo
- Run `yarn` from repo root to install depencencies

### Running Locally

Several components of the Frontend (ex. Filing, Data Browser) require a connection to the [HMDA Platform](https://github.com/cfpb/hmda-platform) in order to operate. You can find instructions for the running the HMDA Platform locally [here](https://github.com/cfpb/hmda-platform#running-with-sbt).

HMDA Help requires a connection to the [HMDA Institutions API](https://github.com/cfpb/hmda-platform/tree/master/institutions-api) in order to operate. You can find instructions for the running the HMDA Institutions API locally [in the README](https://github.com/cfpb/hmda-platform/blob/master/institutions-api/README.md). Note that having the HMDA Platform running is a pre-requisite to starting the HDMA Institutions API.

If your development does not require this integration, `yarn start` will run the development server, opening a browser window to http://localhost:3000.

#### Integrating with the Filing application

By default, the locally running [Frontend is configured to use the Filing API](https://github.com/cfpb/hmda-frontend/blob/master/package.json#L65) from the locally running Platform. In order to go through the Filing process, there are a few elements that need to be completed first:

- Create Institutions (Platform)
- Bypass API authentication (Platform)
- Configure the UI (Frontend)

##### Create Institutions

Before you can submit a Filing you need to have an Institution created on the Platform for each year you want to test. The following command will generate the required data for the default test Institution, for all currently available filing periods. You need to have the HMDA Platform started before running this command:

```
yarn ci-data
```

To create data for an Institution other than the default `FRONTENDTESTBANK9999`, you can modify `cypress/ci/config/institutions.json` and rerun the above command.

This Institution loading needs to be done each time the HMDA Platform is restarted.

##### Bypass API Authentication

On the Platform, you will need to set an environment variable to prevent the API from requiring an authentication token for incoming requests. If already running, you will need to restart the Platform.

```
export HMDA_RUNTIME_MODE=dev
```

##### Configure the UI

If you will be testing against an Institution that is not the default, you can configure this via a `VITE_*` variable:

```
VITE_LEIS=INSTITUTION1,INSTITUTION2
```

Second, you will need to bypass Frontend authentication. This is most easily done by running the Frontend the way we do in a Continuous Integration environment:

```
yarn ci
```

To combine these configuration options

```
VITE_LEIS=INSTITUTION1,INSTITUTION2 yarn ci
```

You can now visit the filing application at http://localhost:3000/filing.

### Running via Docker

To see the application running in a container you can run:

```
docker build -t hmda/hmda-frontend .
docker run -p 8080:8080 hmda/hmda-frontend
```

To build using docker-compose:

```
docker-compose build
```

### Code Formatting

The prettier formatting tool the formatter of choice for this repo.

Prettier Format API: https://prettier.io/docs/en/options.html

The `.prettierrc.json` file contains the specific formatting for each file. <br />
The `.prettierignore` file will ignore formatting any directories or files listed.

In order to have `Prettier` properly format the developers code there are a few steps that developer needs to take.

1. Install the `Prettier` code extension

<a href='./readme-files/prettier-extension.png' alt='Prettier Extension Install'>
  <p align='center'>
    <img src='./readme-files/prettier-extension.png' width='80%'  overflow='scroll'/>
  </p>
</a>

2. Update the developers Visual Studio Code user settings to use the `Prettier` formatter as the default formatter

First open your `settings.json` file by clicking `View` at the top of VS Code then click `Command Palette` and then type what is in the screenshot below.

<a href='./readme-files/navigate-settings-json-file.png' alt='Navigate to Settings JSON File'>
  <p align='center'>
    <img src='./readme-files/navigate-settings-json-file.png' width='80%'  overflow='scroll'/>
  </p>
</a>

Now we need to add 2 lines of code to our JSON file.

```JSON
"editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode",
"editor.formatOnSave": true,
```

The newly added lines tell VS Code to use `Prettier` as the default formatter and will format the code when the file is saved.

### Helpful Prettier formatting scripts

#### Running all files:

```
npx prettier --write
```

#### Directory Specific:

```
npx prettier --write {enter-directory}
```

#### Check files formatting:

```
npx prettier --check
```

The above command will return in the terminal what files have not been formatted by prettier.

#### NOTE: formatting settings that prettier cannot do:

- Format on Paste
  - `"editor.formatOnPaste": true,`
- Themes
- Icon Themes

## Adding GIFs

Why GIFs? GIFs provide a better visual repesentation of how a parituclar part of the UI functions.

Examples that are already in our README

- [HMDA Data Browser](#hmda-data-browser)
- [End to End Testing](#end-to-end-testing)

### Record video to turn into GIF

Navigate to [Apple support native screenshot & recording controls](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/take-a-screenshot-mh26782/mac) to learn how to use MacOS controls.

**Create recording bounds** <br>
On your Mac, press Shift-Command-5 (or use Launchpad) to open Screenshot and display the tools. Drag the bounds to be where it needs to be for recording the video.

Navigate to [Apple support how to record with QuickTime Player](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102618).

### Convert video file to `.gif`

Small file size + lower quality [video to gif converter](https://biteable.com/tools/video-to-gif/). <br>
Large file size + higher quality [video to gif converter](https://cloudconvert.com/mov-to-gif).

### Store the GIF in the Frontend

Navigate to the `readme-files` directory and upload the `.gif` extension this directory.

### How to use GIF in README

Paste the below code to the section you want to import your GIF and update the `name-of-gif` pieces.

```HTML
<a href='./readme-files/name-of-gif.gif' alt='name-of-alt'>
  <p align='center'>
    <img src='./readme-files/name-of-gif.gif' width='80%'  overflow='scroll'/>
  </p>
</a>
```

## Testing

### Unit Tests

```
yarn test
```

### End-to-End Testing

```
yarn run cypress run
```

[Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) is used to perform end-to-end testing of the filing application, tools, data publication products, and data browser. It mimicks a user's interaction with the site and allows for rapid, automated system validation of project deployments.

Whenever a dependency that affects Cypress is added or upgraded in [`package.json`](package.json), you'll need to make the same change in the `cypress` directory's [`package.json` file](cypress/package.json) and then [update the test image](cypress/README.md#updating-the-test-image).
